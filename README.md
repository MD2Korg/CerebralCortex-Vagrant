## Importing and Analyzing Your Data

### Downloading mCerebrum data to your computer

1. **Important**: You must first stop data collection before connecting the smartphone to a computer.

2. Connect the smartphone to a PC using the charging cable.

  ![mCerebrum Computer Interface](imgs/phone2computer.png)

3. Using the computer, navigate to the phoneâ€™s org.md2k.mCerebrum folder. `Phone > Android > data > org.md2k.mCerebrum > files > 636fcc1f-8966-4e63-a9df-0cbaa6e9296c`

  ![mCerebrum Data Folder](imgs/mCerebrum_data_folder.png)

4. Copy all of the `*.gz` and `*.json` files in the folder and paste them to `PATH/TO/CerebralCortex-Vagrant-personal/vagrant_data/raw`

  ![mCerebrum to Cerebral Cortex](imgs/mCerebrum_to_cerebral_cortex.png)

5. Disconnect the smartphone from the computer


### Importing and processing your data

#### Enable Google Places API (optional)

Some of the features that can be computed rely on the Google Places API and if you would like to include this optional capability, the following steps are required to configure this option.

1. Navigate to [developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/) and sign in with a valid Google account.

2. Navigate to the places web-service `Get API Key` page https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/get-api-key

3. Follow the steps to `Get A Key` for the __standard Places API for Web__ option. By default, the key is good for 1000 queries/day and can be increased to 150k/day by verifying your identity with a credit card.

4. Run the following command to enable the location-aware features in the Cerebral Cortex pipeline.

  ```bash
  vagrant ssh
  enable_google_places.sh COPY_KEY_HERE
  ```

#### Import and analyze the data
Data can now be processed, which can take some time due to the CPU intensive nature of computing all the features and markers.

  ```bash
  vagrant ssh
  ingest_and_analyze.sh
  ```

A large number of console logs will appear on the screen indicating what the system is currently doing.  It will first preprocess the data files you copied from the mCerebrum app into a format that Cerebral Cortex will ingest.  Next, the ingestion pipeline will scan and import this data into Cerebral Cortex's internal data stores.  Finally, it will run a pre-specified set of feature computations based on the smartphone sensors streams.


# Visualizing and Analyzing Your Data
Cerebral Cortex provides two mechanisms to visualize and analyze your data.  First, a user-centric interface is provided by the [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) project which can be utilized to plot and explore Cerebral Cortex data streams.  Second, a code-centric interface is provided by the [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) project and allows a user to write Python3 code to interact with the Cerebral Cortex kernel.

## Visualization of data with Grafana
Open this link in your web browser http://localhost:8080/grafana/login to visualize your data.  

1. The default login and password are both `admin`.  

  ![Grafana](imgs/grafana.png)


2. Once you authenticate, you will see the following screen.

  ![Grafana Main](imgs/grafana-main.png)


3. Select the `Home` dropdown at the top left of the screen and choose the **MD2K_DEMO** dashboard.

  ![Grafana Visualization](imgs/grafana-main-dashboard.png)


This is a pre-built visualization that provides some examples of the various types of displays that are possible.  

For example, ... (TWH Complete this with data)
- Data Yield of MSHRV-LED, MSHRV-Accel, AutoSenseBLE
- Geolocation
- Phone/SMS/Notifications
- Phone screen touches

You may [create additional dashboards](http://docs.grafana.org/guides/getting_started/) to visualize all of the raw and processed data.


## Analyzing your data with Jupyter Notebooks
Open this link in your web browser http://localhost:8080/jupyterhub/hub/login to interact and analyze your data.  

1. A login screen will be shown as follows.  

  The username and password are both `md2k`.  The warning shown is because this site is running locally on your machine and is not secured by a security certificate.  There is no data leaving the machine and going across the internet.

  ![Jupyter Hub](imgs/jupyter.png)


2. A file browser will appear after successful authentication and you should choose the `cc_demo` folder.

  ![Jupyter Files](imgs/jupyter-files.png)

  ![Jupyter Demo](imgs/jupyter-demo.png)


3. Click on the `CerebralCortex_Basic_Usage.ipynb` and it will open in a new tab.  This provides an overview of how to utilize Cerebral Cortex and visualize some data.

  ![Jupyter Cerebral Cortex Demo](imgs/jupyter-CC-demo.png)


This example notebook demonstrates the following:
  - Import CerebralCortex libraries and loading configurations
  - Get all users of a study
  - Get all streams of a user
  - Get days when a stream has data available
  - Get a stream's raw data and metadata
  - Plot stream raw data


### Creating your own scripts

  1. Authenticate with user credentials
  2. Click on Files tab
  3. Click on new and select `pySpark (Spark 2.2.0) (Python 3)` to create a new Python script.


## Computing features
The [CerebralCortex-DataAnalysis](https://github.com/MD2Korg/CerebralCortex-DataAnalysis) repository is available within the Vagrant virtual machine and is accessible through the Jupyter interface.  This repository contains the code to compute features on the data. These features are located in the `core/feature` directory.

The following features have been validated by our team and are considered stable with the remaining features still
under development. Please have a look at the documentation for each of the above features to get more insight into their functionality. Sensors/features in parentheses should be considered dependencies to compute the specified feature.

#### Stable Features
  * phone_features (Smartphone)
  * gpsfeature (Smartphone, gps, gps_daily)
  * puffmarker (MotionSenseHRV)
  * rr_interval (MotionSenseHRV)

#### Features Under Development
  * xxx
  * yyy
